# ToT
ToT is a 2D Top Down Community Driven Legend of Zelda Like MMORPG with intentions to feel like the old classic MapleStory era.
The game will feature multiple classes and broad character customization options, such as hair styles and clothing. It will also feature a Cash Shop where you can buy apperal items and EXP Multiplier items with real money.
We plan to stray away from the Pay To Win aspect like in most MMORPGs, and the pure intention of the game is to have fun in development and to have a learning expierence in how MMORPG clients and servers function.

The game is coded in C# and the .NET Bindings of SFML, Visual Studio 2017 is reccommended to compile and run the application, we do accept private servers and will indeed allow new servers to be linked to our main hub with new Game Moderators added per server.

The official servers will vary in experience and gold rates depending on which server you go on, some people enjoy a slow paced game while others enjoy a more fast paced game, so the idea is to appeal to people of both classes and keep a friendly community.
